# Introduction

Welcome to the Axiom Documentation, an introductory book about the all-in-one tool for editing Minecraft worlds. The goal of Axiom is to help you build terrain, organics and structures faster and to a higher quality. The mod brings innovative new tools and algorithms, while also improving ergonomics by reducing the feedback loop through realtime clientside visualizations. 

## Who Axiom Is For

Axiom is intended for everyone from novice to professional. The tools are intuitive and easy to approach, while still providing lots of depth through settings for experienced users.

## Basic Controls

To access the [Builder Mode](builder/intro.md) menu, press Left Alt

To open/close the [Editor Mode](editor/intro.md), press Right Shift

These keybinds can be adjusted in Minecraft's controls menu (Esc > Options > Controls)

## Latest Update 

Update 3.0.0 introduced the [Script Brush](tools/painting/scriptbrush.md). This tool has been on the todo list for months but it's finally here! This unique tool introduces many new possibilities as it allows users to create their own brush with its own unique functionality.

There is another new operation called 'Export Clipboard to JSON Model' and it can be found under the Operations menu in the [Main Menu Bar](editor/mainmenubar.md). Alongside this, some smaller features such as the '/axiomtogglecapability' [Command](advanced/commands.md) and some bug fixes.
