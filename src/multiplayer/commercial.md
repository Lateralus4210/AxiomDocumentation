# Commercial Usage

## How It Works

If you make any profit[^note1] by selling your Axiom builds, you'll need to purchase a Commercial License. 

Even if Axiom was used for a few minutes, you must purchase a commercial license.

### Where To Buy

You can purchase commercial licenses from [here](https://axiom.moulberry.com/commercial).

If you haven't already, you'll need to sign in with Google by pressing the purple 'Sign In' button. Now you'll be able to agree to the EULA[^note2] located at the bottom of the page. After agreeing to the EULA, you'll be presented with the licenses  

## Commercial Features

With a Commercial License, you'll be able to use multiple exclusive features.

- History Persistence

History Persistance keeps your history between worlds, allowing you to leave the server knowing your history hasn't been lost. For servers, the history is stored on the server itself rather than the client.

- Blueprint sharing on servers

[Shared Blueprints](/editor/windows/blueprints.md#Multiplayer) are used to share blueprints with other players on the server. 

- Schematic Version Exporting (1.7 to 1.20)

Allows [Exporting Schematics](/editor/mainmenubar.md) for different verions all the way back to 1.7.

- Custom Server APIs

Leverage powerful server APIs like serverside custom blocks to accelerate development.

## Whitelists

Whitelists are used when playing on servers for non-commercial[^note1] purposes. For example, playing with friends to build a house with Axiom. 

You cannot use a whitelist for selling your houses made with Axiom.

Whitelists must be requested and last for 30 days each. You can request multiple but cannot request for a whitelist in advance.

You can request a whitelist from the [Discord](). You should read the #whitelist-request channel as it provides you with the information on how to request a whitelist.

After you've requested your whitelist, it will take less than 24 hours to be reviewed. This is due to the process being manual and there are many requests to go through at a time.

Now you should be able to use axiom on multiplayer.

After 30 days you'll be prompted to renew your whitelist with a message in the chat.

## Notes

[^note1]: In this context, commercial means the server itself makes money. For example, selling your worlds made with Axiom on Patreon. However, this doesn't include profiting from YouTube by showcasing your Axiom builds.
