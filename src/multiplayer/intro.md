# Multiplayer

With multiplayer, you can access multiple exclusive features such as the ability to teleport to other players using the [Editor UI](/editor/intro.md).

Axiom is available for Paper and Fabric servers. To use Axiom on a Paper server, you'll need to have the plugin on the server. You can download the plugin from [here](https://modrinth.com/plugin/axiom-paper-plugin). To use Axiom on a Fabric server, you can use the base mod from [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/axiom) and place it in the plugins folder.

If you're using Axiom for commercial purposes, you'll need to purchase a [Commercial License](commercial.md).
