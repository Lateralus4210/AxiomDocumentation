# Clipboard and Placements

## Clipboard

A selection can be copied to the clipboard using Ctrl+C. 

With blocks in your clipboard, you can paste back into the world by hovering over the desired location using your cursor position and pressing Ctrl+V. Pasting like this will initiate a [Placement](/editor/placement.md).

The clipboard can be cleared by right-clicking the icon and choosing the 'clear' option. 

## Rotation and Scaling

While the [placement](/editor/placement.md) is initiated and the [Gizmo](/editor/gizmos.md) is visible, some [options](/editor/placement.md#placement-options) will appear on your [View](views.md) window[^note1]. 

> Tip: Left-clicking the 'Empty' clipboard icon opens up the [Blueprint Browser](blueprints.md).

> Tip: You can set the Cut function save to the clipboard in the [Keybinds Menu](/editor/mainmenubar.md#Keybinds).

## Notes

[^note1]: For versions 3.0.0 and below, the options will appear inside the clipboard window.
