# Selections

A **Selection** is a set of highlighted blocks that affect the functionality of other systems.

There are many selection tools in Axiom that you can use to make selections. Each of these tools feature several options to further fine-tune what and how you might want to select something. See [Selection Tools](/tools/selection/intro.md) for more info.

- With a selection, you can constrain the brush strokes of [Tools](/tools/intro.md).

- [Operations](/editor/mainmenubar/operations.md) rely on selections to affect blocks within a region.

Finally, to clear a selection, use '[Select](/editor/mainmenubar/select.md) -> Clear' or press the Enter key

Below are a few keybinds that can be used to move and copy selections.
- `Ctrl+C`
  - Copies the selection to the [Clipboard](/editor/windows/clipboard.md)
- `Ctrl+X`
  - Cuts the selection, allowing you to move it anywhere you'd like using the [Gizmo](gizmos.md)
- `Ctrl+J`
  - Duplicates the selection, similar to cut, but doesn't remove the blocks in the process.
