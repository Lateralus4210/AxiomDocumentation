# File

The 'File' drop-down provides many useful features regarding loading and saving files to use within Axiom. 

## Import Schematic

When pressed, a file explorer window will be opened. Here you can select a schematic to import into Axiom. Both `.schem` and `.schematic` are supported, however only one schematic can be loaded at a time.

After you've opened a schematic in your file explorer, it will be loaded into your [Clipboard](/editor/windows/clipboard.md).

## Export Schematic

The Export Schematic option allows you to export a schematic using your clipboard. Once you have something in your clipboard, you'll be able to export it as a schematic.

For users with a [Commercial License](https://axiom.moulberry.com/commercial), you'll be able to export to any version from 1.7 to 1.19.

## Open Reference Image

Opens a file explorer window for you to select an image to be loaded into Axiom. Once opened, you can drag and resize the image window to wherever you want. 

Right-Clicking on an image window will display some options to adjust the reference image.

- **Close Window** removes the image.
- **Set Filtering: Nearest** "smoothes" out sharp pixels to reduce the blocky look. 
- **Set Filtering: Linear** stops it from smoothing out pixels, leaving the sharp edges.
- **Show In Game UI** makes it so the image is always shown. When disabled, the image is hidden when outside of the [Editor](/editor/intro.md).
- **Borderless** removes the outer padding and resizing tab.

## Load Bedrock Packs

This is a [Commercial License](https://axiom.moulberry.com/commercial) feature.

The 'Load Bedrock Packs' option allows you to replace existing models with Bedrock Edition models. 

This would be most used by Bedrock Marketplace creators who would want to see their models on Java.

## Save Selection as CSV

Exports a [Selection](/editor/selections.md) to a Comma-Seperated Value (CSV) format.

## Save Clipboard as JSON Model

This allows you to convert your clipboard to an item model. Models can be used in resource packs or imported into Blockbench.
