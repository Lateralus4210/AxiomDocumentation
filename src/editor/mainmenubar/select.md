# Select
    
The Select submenu lets users perform a variety of functions to modify [Selections](/tools/selection/intro.md).
    
| Function     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear        | Clears the current selection                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Expand       | Expands the current selection by a specified number of blocks                                                                                                                                                        |
| Shrink       | Shrinks the current selection by a specified number of blocks                                                                                                                                                        |
| Distort      | Distorts the current selection with simplex noise by a specified radius and distance. Radius is the scale of the noise and the distance is the amount it gets distorted by.                                          |
| Smooth       | Applies a Gaussian blur on the selection to smooth out the selection. StdDev is the intensity of the smoothing operation and the threshold is the 'cut-off' of how much input weight is needed to affect the output. |
| Bounding Box | Creates a cuboid selection around the furthest points of the selection, encapsulating the entire selection.                                                                                                          |
