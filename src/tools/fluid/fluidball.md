# Fluid Ball

The Fluid Ball tool is a brush which can be used to set sources of either water, lava or snow. With the default settings, the fluid is spread across the terrain, away from the drawn source. On sloped terrain, the fluid's flow is influenced by the slope.

The following tool options control the flow and generation of fluids.

| Option                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fluid Type**                    | Switch between water, lava or snow using this drop-down.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Quality**                       | The **Quality** slider determines how 'Smooth' the water flows. Turning this up too much will result in diminishing returns                                                              |
| **Flow Length**                   | The **Flow Length** slider determines how far water will flow from a source block.                                                                                                       |
| **Remove Fluids Without Sources** | The **Remove Fluids Without Sources** option toggles the requirement of source blocks to create water flow. This can be useful when using the Fluid Ball tool on slopes.                 |
| **Fill Edges**                    | The **Fill Edges** option toggles the filling of corners when in a contained environment. If a source can fill a container, the fluid level will be flattened out to fill the container. |
