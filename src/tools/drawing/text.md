# Text

The **Text** tool lets the user write text with any True Type Font or .ttf file font in the world. It can be configured to have a smaller or larger font scale

To start writing, enter text in the 'Text' option. After text has been input, right-clicking a position in the world will create a [Placement](/editor/placement.md) with the text.

The direction can be altered using the 'Direction' drop-down.

## Font Options

The 'Size' [slider](/editor/intro.md#sliders) changes how large the text is.

The 'Use Builtin Font' toggle allows for importing custom fonts when disabled.

---

The 'Use Full Blocks' toggle removes stairs and slabs from the text if the active block has those variants.
