# Elevation

The **Elevation Tool** can raise and lower pre-existing terrain. Its main feature is the ability to add custom heightmaps. These modify the elevation depending on the brightness in the image provided.

| Option         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Y Limit        | This determines the height of the cylindrical shape to affect surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Mode           | Determines how the terrain is affected. **Raise**, **Lower** and **Flatten** are some of the modes.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Smoothing      | Determines how smooth the elevation will turn out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Apply          | This dropdown allows you to switch between a single application and a continuous application.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rate / Amount  | These determine how many blocks are applied at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Falloff        | The falloff determines how the elevation is applied around the center.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Load Heightmap | Similar to falloff, heightmaps allow for further modification to the elevation. Pressing "Load Heightmap" will open an explorer window prompting you to choose an image. When using a coloured image, the image will automatically be converted to black and white. |
