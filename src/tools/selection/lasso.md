# Lasso Select

The lasso select is very unique, it allows the user to draw out a shape on screen to determine the selection.

To draw the selection, use right-click and draw out the looped shape. After releasing right-click, the drawn outline will be cast to the blocks within your view. You can set the depth of the selection by adjusting the **Depth** slider.

Enabling the 'Include Non-Solid' will allow the selection to include blocks such as short grass.
