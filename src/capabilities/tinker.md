# Tinker

The **Tinker** capability has various features related to right-clicking with your fist on blocks. Tinker often can be used in place of the debug stick, being slighty faster compared to the debug stick's clunky interface but sometimes lacking the ability to change some non-visual properties.

Aiming at specific parts of a block can change the effect of the tinker. This lets you quickly change full blocks into stairs, stairs into slabs and vice versa. It also lets you easily adjust walls/fences to create states that Minecraft normally doesn’t allow.

Tinker interactions can be negated while the capability is toggled on by either having a non-empty hand or by holding down the sneak or ‘shift’ button.
