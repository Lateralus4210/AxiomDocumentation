The **Bulldozer** capability allows you to break blocks very quickly after an initial warmup period. In many cases, bulldozer can be faster and more convenient than the alternatives: configuring a left-click macro, breaking blocks slowly by holding left-click, or making a selection and running //set air.

To use Bulldozer, simply start holding down the left mouse button. Your breaking speed will increase after a short warmup period, which is designed to prevent accidental mass destruction when you only intend to break a small number of blocks.

In addition to being more convenient than a left-click macro, the bulldozer capability also has a faster update rate to prevent misses.
