# Marker Entities 

> Similar to [Display Enities](displayentities.md)

**Marker Entities** are a vanilla minecraft[^note1] feature which was added in 1.17. Essentially, they are entities that have little to no behaviour. Axiom takes advantage of this and provides a [Gizmo](/editor/gizmos.md) to control the marker.

Right-clicking the marker gizmo will open a menu, allowing you to input custom NBT for the marker.

Using `Ctrl+C` while the gizmo is active, will copy the marker data to the clipboard. Using `Ctrl+V` will paste the copied marker into the world.
