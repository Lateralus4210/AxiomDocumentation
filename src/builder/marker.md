# Marker Entities 

**Marker Entities** are a vanilla minecraft[^note1] feature which was added in 1.17. Essentially, they are entities that have little to no behaviour. Axiom takes advantage of this and provides a [Gizmo](/editor/gizmos.md) to control the marker.

Right-clicking the marker gizmo will open a menu, allowing you to input custom NBT for the marker.
