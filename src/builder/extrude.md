# ![](/img/buildertools/extrude.png) Extrude

Extrude is a unique builder tool as it doesn't use a selection. Extrude simply extrudes and shrinks a face of the same block.

To extrude a face, use right-click. To shrink a face, use left-click.

If you're not happy with the result, use `Ctrl + Z` to undo the placement. If you can't make up your mind, you can use `Ctrl + Y` to redo your undo.

Below is a video showcasing the extrude tool.
