# ![](/img/buildertools/erase.png) Erase 

Erase allows for removing a cuboid selection, or 128 connected blocks of the same type.

## Creating Selections

To create a selection, start by using left-click to select your first corner and then right-click to select the second. You can use middle-click to select faces instead of the corners. This makes it much easier to select blocks that don't already have edges.

With a selection, you're still able to expand the selection with middle-click. Using left or right-click also works to set a corner again.

## Confirming Selections

After you're happy with your selection, use the `del` or `backspace` key on your keyboard to remove the selected area. 

If you're not happy with the result, use `Ctrl + Z` to undo the deletion. If you can't make up your mind, you can use `Ctrl + Y` to redo your undo.

## Erase Connected

To remove the nearest 128 blocks of the same type, use right-click while facing at the block you'd like to remove. The use of `Ctrl + Z` and `Ctrl + Y` still applies.

Below is a demonstration of both methods.
